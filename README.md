-  ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Red and Dark Blue. Used white and a little bit of Purple color for contrast.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Lato means 'Summer' in Polish. It is easy and clear to read and belongs to the three most popular font sizes used.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. The big red N and dark Blue background are catching for the eye.
